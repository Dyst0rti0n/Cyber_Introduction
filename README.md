## What computer do I need ?
One of the most common questions concerns the required specifications of a computer for learning hacking. To put it simply:
- at least i5 / Ryzen 5 > multiple cores for virtual machines (will discuss about it later)
- at least 8gb of RAM > also for the virtual machines
- Internet access
and that's all.

*You don't need a 3000$ gaming laptop, you don't need specific devices, just an averge computer will be enough.*

## Introduction
Clarification of terms:

**CYBERSECURITY:** this is a vast field that includes many fields of activity, so when we talk about cyber security, we are talking about many professions (discussed below) that ensure the security of information systems and computer data.

**ETHICAL HACKING:** this is a category of activity that uses hacking within a regulated and legal framework, for which a client has signed an agreement defining the scope of the intervention and the conditions. This ethical hacking aims to find security flaws and fix them so that they cannot be exploited. Ethical hacking can intervene on systems, the network, applications, software (as with Bug Bounty) and report them to the person who owns the vulnerable element so that he can correct the flaw.

**HACKTIVISM:** is a portmanteau of "hack" and "activism." It refers to the use of hacking techniques and tools to promote a political or social agenda. Hacktivists engage in cyber activities, such as website defacement, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, and data breaches, to express their views or protest against perceived injustices. The goal of hacktivism is often to raise awareness, promote political change, or draw attention to a particular cause. Even if hacktivism has praiseworthy intentions, their methods are not legal.

## Hacker's hat (official)
You will encounter these terms so it's vital to understand them to know on which side you are, and who are your enemy.

**WHITE HAT:** refers to an ethical hacker or a cybersecurity professional who uses their skills to help protect computer systems, networks, and applications. White hat hackers work to identify and fix security vulnerabilities before malicious actors (black hat hackers) can exploit them. Their activities are typically authorized and conducted with the goal of improving cybersecurity and preventing unauthorized access, data breaches, and other malicious activities.

**BLACK HAT:** refers to a hacker or cybercriminal who engages in activities with malicious intent. Black hat hackers are individuals who use their technical skills to exploit computer systems, networks, or software for personal gain, unauthorized access, or to cause harm. Their actions often involve activities such as stealing sensitive data, spreading malware, conducting cyber attacks, or engaging in other forms of cybercrime.

**GREY HAT:** refers to a hacker or cybersecurity professional who may engage in activities that fall somewhere between ethical and unethical behaviour. Grey hat hackers do not have malicious intentions like black hat hackers, who engage in unauthorized and malicious activities for personal gain or to cause harm. Instead, gray hat hackers may conduct activities without proper authorization but with the intention of discovering and fixing vulnerabilities, often in a somewhat unauthorized or unorthodox manner.

## Hacker's hat (non-official)
Non widely used, but always good to know them.

**RED HAT:** also known as a “vigilante hacker,” uses their skills against cyber criminals and organizations that do not meet their own moral values or high standards of justice. Like any vigilante, they act outside of the law and are willing to break the rules if necessary in order to get what they want. Overall, red hat hackers are driven by a sense of justice and the desire to build a safer, more just, and more accessible world — based on their standards.

**BLUE HAT:** some contexts may use "blue hat" to refer to a security professional who is invited to test a system's security or identify vulnerabilities from an outsider's perspective. This role is more similar to a penetration tester or ethical hacker. The use of "blue hat" in this sense is less common and may be associated with specific events or scenarios rather than a universally recognized category.

**GREEN HAT:** newcomers to the hacking scene, often referred to as "green hat hackers." While lacking awareness of security mechanisms and the intricacies of the web, they exhibit a strong eagerness to learn and a determined, if not desperate, drive to advance in the hacker community. Although their primary goal may not be to inflict harm, their experimentation with different malware and attack techniques could inadvertently lead to unintended consequences.

## Cybersecurity Jobs
For most people, when you talk about cybersecurity, they think about pentesters. However, cybersecurity is a large field with at least a hundred different cybersecurity jobs. Being aware of that will help you focus on studies and knowledge that are related to the career you want to pursue. Congratulations, you saved a few months by not studying things that are not relevant to your career. However, if you don't know what you want to do yet, be aware that some knowledge is common to every job. I'll show you below what these are.

Here is an example of cybersecurity jobs :

                         **Learn to walk before you run.**
## Take it small
Many new to cybersecurity want to dive straight into hacking without prior system, network, or security knowledge. At best they will go around in circles, look for solutions on the Internet, or worse follow tutorials that are dangerous for their computer and their data.
![[Pasted image 20240410015045.png]]

## Work on different areas fairly
In a class where you cover various subjects each week, it's crucial to consistently make progress across all areas to avoid being too far ahead in some and falling behind in others. This balance poses one of the greatest challenges in computer security.

In cybersecurity, every facet is interconnected—systems, coding, networks, encryption. Neglecting one area over another could hinder your understanding of certain concepts later on.

Similar to how I've monitored my skills to prepare for working in a SOC, you can use the different categories mentioned in this thread to track your progress. I've set this up using Notion :

![[Pasted image 20240410015108.png]]


## Study regularly

Working in cybersecurity is more of a marathon than a sprint. On the other hand, if you study a lot for a short period of time and then leave it aside, when you come back to it you will have forgotten a good part. Dedicate a few hours a day to this.

![[Pasted image 20240410015134.png]]

## Be organized

It's impossible to retain all information over the span of several years, particularly as technologies evolve. When you're studying, don't forget to take notes (using tools like OneNote, Obsidian, etc.). Your web browser can also be an invaluable resource for organizing information. You can save bookmarks there, organizing them into folders that suit your needs (such as Security Tools, Hacking Tools, OSINT, e-learning, Malware, Coding, etc.).

Here's how I organize my bookmarks: I use Firefox with an account, so all my bookmarks sync across my various devices. This way, I can add content even when I only have my smartphone. If I come across an article about a tool or something else useful, I can easily bookmark it for later reference :

![[Pasted image 20240410015149.png]]


## Stay informed on the news

The world of cybersecurity is subject to daily developments through new technologies, threats, tools, attack techniques, security breaches, algorithms, news items. Even if you manage (and I hope you will) to get a job in this field, you will have to keep yourself constantly informed of the news, so start today.

You can start simply with a few links to consult manually and daily, such as: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/, or you can organize yourself to collect the most interesting feeds through tools like https://feedly.com/

![[Pasted image 20240410015207.png]]

In 2023 I discovered this website that aggregate every news from popular websites : https://allinfosecnews.com/


## Try to get an idea now about your future cybersecurity job

As we have mentioned, cybersecurity is a vast field that includes many professions and therefore many varied skills. In order to know where to start it is essential to consider the question of knowing “what is the cybersecurity profession that interests us”. Here is a list of different cybersecurity jobs :

Knowing which career you are going to go into will help you define a path you will follow to achieve your goal effectively. Here is a link that could help you to build you career path, take a look at it : https://www.cyberseek.org/

A great video that explains why learning cybersecurity is hard, please take few minutes to watch it.
https://youtu.be/vI79qT4lcfA


## Don't be shy to practice

You'll realize that there are tons of things to learn for cybersecurity (if you watched the video above, you should already have an idea of what I'm talking about). Practice is essential to understand what you are studying and how they work in the real world. Here are some ways to practice :

- Use dedicated platforms such as tryhackme, hackthebox, and so on ...
- Try to hack your own devices (smartphones, computers, wifi, ...)
- Build your own home lab with physical and virtual appliances, having a physical lab is so satisfying. This will really help your to practice on networking, servers (Windows, Linux), virtualization, ... you don't need a lot of money to start there are lot of second hand devices sold for cheap, get an idea here : https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeLabPorn/

**Don't forget that you should practice only on stuff you own or you are allowed to practice on. Don't run scans on IP your don't own!**

By now, I think you are beginning to understand the scope of the field and therefore the variety of skills for each profession. Answering this question requires knowing what career you want to pursue. However, if you are not sure yet, there are still some common skills in these areas that you can start studying. In the rest of this thread we will highlight these common skills.


## One more thing ...

![[Pasted image 20240410015641.png]]Learning cybersecurity is far from being an easy task, but in 2024 things are way easier than before. I highly encourage you to use AI if you have a question (you can even use it for coding / scripting, but that doesn't mean you can skip learning them !). Think how it was before AI, think how it was before the Internet, think how far we came from and how people were already able to learn. You can also learn for sure, if you put in the effort.

*The best way to start and to not harm yourself is to understand the concept of virtualization and virtual machines.*

## What should I know ?

### What is a virtual machine ?
A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system and applications. It operates as an isolated environment on a host system, allowing multiple virtual machines to run simultaneously on the same physical hardware. Each virtual machine has its own virtualized resources, including CPU, memory, storage, and network interfaces, and it functions as if it were an independent, self-contained computer. Virtualization technology enables efficient resource utilization, isolation, and flexibility in managing and deploying various operating systems and applications on a single physical host.

### What is an hypervisor ?
A hypervisor, also known as a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), is a software or hardware layer that enables the virtualization of multiple operating systems on a single physical host. It manages and allocates the host's hardware resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to create and run multiple virtual machines. There are two main types of hypervisors:

Type 1, which runs directly on the hardware such as :
- Proxmox, VMware ESXi

Type 2, which runs as a software layer on top of an existing operating system (marked as "host" which can be your Windows, Linux or MacOS) such as :
- VirtualBox, VMware Player

![[Pasted image 20240410021509.png]]

## What is a snapshot ?
A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of the VM's state, including its memory, settings, and the contents of its virtual hard disks. Snapshots allow you to capture the current state of a VM so that you can revert to that state later if needed (in case you broke your system by deleting system files, accounts, conf files, ...). If you're not familiar with a system (such as Linux), using it through a VM is the best way to learn without reinstalling your OS every time your mess up.

## What is a template ?
A template is a pre-configured and standardized image or blueprint used to create new VM instances. Templates are created from a base VM or a virtual machine snapshot and typically include the guest operating system, system configurations, installed software, and other settings. The purpose of using templates is to streamline and automate the process of deploying multiple VMs with similar configurations.

## How can I learn ?
o [YouTube] NetworkChuck > You need to learn Virtual Machines RIGHT NOW!! 

## How can I practice ?
o VirtualBox : https://www.virtualbox.org/
o VMware Workstation Player : https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html
o VMware Workstation Pro : https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html
o VMware ESXi (for servers) : https://www.vmware.com/products/esxi-and-esx.html
o VMware Fusion (mac users) : https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html
o Parallels Desktop (mac users) : https://www.parallels.com
(I usually recommend VMware Workstation Pro, keys to activate can be found here *site:gist.github.com VMware workstation pro 17*)

There are other features useful to know and that are usually common on type 2 hypervisors, such as :

- 📂 Shared folder : you can decide if your virtual machine can access shared folders on your host (so you can easily share files)
- 🔁 AutoProtect : automatically create a snapshot based on a schedule you configure (every hour, every day, etc)
- 🔒 Guest isolation : enable/disable drag and drop and/or copy and past between your host and your VM
- 🔑 Access control : you can encrypt your virtual machine so you'll need to type a password to access it
- and many more

## Usages

Virtualization is often used by companies to reduce the cost of hosting servers (1 physical server with many virtual machines inside, instead of having multiple physical server).

Virtualization is often used for malware analysis, however it needs to take the appropriated measures to secure your environment. Some malware are able of "VM escaping" to infect the host of the VM or worst, to infect the firmware of your components (rootkit). Some malware are able to detect the virtualized environment so they won't execute their malicious payload to no be detected.

## Containerisation

Aside of virtualisation, you may encounter a new term called "Containerisation". Containerisation is a lightweight form of virtualisation that allows applications and their dependencies to be packaged together in a consistent and portable unit called a container. Containers provide a way to encapsulate an application and its runtime environment, including libraries and other dependencies, into a single package. This package can then be deployed and executed consistently across different computing environments.

Here is a representation of containerisation architecture and the difference with a virtual machine :

![[Pasted image 20240410023126.png]]

Some OS are based on this principle, such as QubeOS. You can learn more about containerisation and the most used solution Docker here : https://www.docker.com/

*The most important field, no matter the cybersecurity job you'll apply for!*

Networking is fundamental, if not considered the most important field, in hacking and cybersecurity. In every job you'll work, you'll need knowledge related to this field. Most beginners usually skip this part because it's not as interesting as hacking, but you can't really hack and understand what you are doing if you don't have the basics of networking.

## What should I know ?

To be honest, this section is so wide that I would need many posts to develop all of the concepts, so for this part I decided to link you the useful materials to learn every concept :

o OSI model (layers, data types, transport modes, protocols related to each layer, ...)
o IP addresses (IPv4, IPv6, public, private, how they are constructed, how they are distributed, ...)
o Protocols
![[Pasted image 20240410023329.png]]

o Methods of sending packets
o Communication over a network
o Encryption algorithms
o The operation of the different types of firewall (stateful, stateless, app level, circuit level, NGFW, UTM, etc.)
o Wired, wireless (and related protocols)

## How can I learn ?

o Network Direction https://www.youtube.com/@NetworkDirection
o David Bombal https://www.youtube.com/@davidbombal

## How can I practice ?
### Physically :
o Buy a router
o Buy a firewall (Fortigate)
o Buy a manageable switch (Cisco / HP)
o Buy a manageable access point (Cisco / HP / Aruba)
o Install Pfsense on an old computer

*Having a home lab is the best way to fully understand the role of each component and how they work. You can easily find second hand products for cheap, here is a Reddit to look at home labs from people:* https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeLabPorn/

### Virtually :
o Use a virtual appliance of a firewall (Pfsense, FortiOS, Sophos, etc)
o Use Cisco Packet Tracer

This is packet tracer from Cisco. Most of student learn with this software, however it's limited to Cisco products.

![[Pasted image 20240410024450.png]]

o Use GNS3 (A little bit more hard to master than Packet Tracer)

This is what GNS3 looks like: you basically add virtual appliances, access their CLI, and modify their configuration so you can make them communicate. GNS3 is widely used by beginners to understand how networking works. Students often use it or Packet Tracer if they intend to work as sys/network admins. Here you don't need to spend money on physical appliances if you can't afford them.

![[Pasted image 20240410024505.png]]

o Use Wireshark

This is what Wireshark looks like: it's a packet sniffer software, which means you can inspect the data transferred on the network interface card (NIC). *This software is more advanced and is used for network troubleshooting, as well as in threat hunting, malware analysis, and forensic analysis.*
There is a Wireshark cert called WCNA that could be useful for you if you intend to work with this tool :

*The OS of all cybersecurity soldiers, put your hands inside the power of Linux!*

## What should I know ?
o The differences between UNIX, GNU and Linux

Unix is an operating system developed in the late 1960s. Over time, various commercial versions of Unix were created by different vendors.

GNU (GNU's Not Unix) is a project initiated by Richard Stallman in 1983 to develop a free and open-source Unix-like operating system. It includes essential software components like utilities, compilers, and libraries.

Linux is a Unix-like kernel created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. When combined with the GNU operating system components, it forms a complete, free, and open-source Unix-like operating system commonly referred to as "GNU/Linux" or just "Linux."

In essence, Linux is the kernel, GNU provides essential software, and together they form a complete operating system inspired by Unix principles. The combination of Linux and GNU components is what is commonly used as a modern, open-source alternative to traditional Unix systems.

![[Pasted image 20240410024620.png]]
If you pay attention to the graphic above, you can see that MacOS is based on FreeBSD, so Mac computers (such as the mac mini) are good computers for some tools such as Pfsense which is also based on FreeBSD so all the components are compatible (so you can buy a cheap second-hand Mac mini for your home lab, works like a charm 👍)

## What are the different distros

When you dive into the Linux' world you'll encounter hundreds of different distributions (called distros). Unlike Windows (which have only few versions during decades, XP, Vista, 7, 10, 11), Linux distros are created by people or companies who are looking for an operating system, based on Linux, that replies to a specific need. Let me explain :

- When you install Windows on your computer, it comes with every package included by Microsoft.
- If your computer is very old, you have no choice to install the full version of Windows with all processes, services, that will slow down your computer, even if you don't need them.
- If you have a specific usage of your computer, you'll need to manually install every software each time you install Windows.

Here you have a graphic that presents all Linux distributions : Wikipedia

You can know more about Linux distributions on this website https://distrowatch.com/

You can even try 60 different Linux distributions online if you can't download ISO files, or if you don't want to setup VM : https://distrosea.com/

o What are the different environment

One of the key features of Linux is the ability to customize your interface and use different environments. These environments encompass icons, docks, top bars, file explorers, system interfaces, options menus, and more. Some are more focused on aesthetics (such as Plasma and GNOME), while others prioritize lightweight performance (such as XFCE and MATE), which can be adapted for low-performance computers, for example.

![[Pasted image 20240410024650.png]]

o Linux command line
You can't claim to be a cybersecurity soldier if you're not able to use the command line. Initially, operating systems didn't have graphical user interfaces; there was only the command line. Then, as computers became more popular and had more users, engineers needed to find a way to make them easier to use for non-technical people, so graphical user interfaces were built.

Even though the user interface is easier to use initially, you can't do everything you can with the command line. Additionally, for specific purposes such as automation, scripting, and many repetitive tasks, the user interface is not the best option.

Moreover, most tools created for cybersecurity and hacking operate in the command line. Why? Because it's less time-consuming and more compatible to develop a program that works in the command line than with a graphical interface. Feeling comfortable with the CLI is a must-have skill.

Below, I added few sources you can use to learn more about all the commands available on Linux.

o Linux Shells

A shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by typing commands. It acts as an interpreter between the user and the kernel (the core of the operating system), facilitating the execution of commands and running programs.

![[Pasted image 20240410024712.png]]

o Linux directory structure

![[Pasted image 20240410024724.png]]
Credits : https://www.makeuseof.com/linux-director...explained/

**/ (root) :** The root directory, represented by a forward slash (/), stores all the directories in Linux. If you cd into this directory and use the ls command, you will find a list of all the directories on your machine. The absolute path of every file passes through the root directory as it is the parent to all other directories.

**/boot :** The boot directory contains important files needed by the boot loader. The initial ram file system or initramfs is also stored here along with the kernel. You shouldn't tinker with this directory on your primary machine. If you wish to experiment, feel free to do so in a virtual machine.

**/dev :** Linux treats everything as a file, and hardware is not an exception to this rule. The /dev directory contains special, virtual files representing hardware components like a mouse, keyboard, storage devices, etc., connected to your system.

**/etc :** The /etc directory contains vital system configuration files such as startup scripts, networking files, user account-related files, etc. You have to edit configuration files in the /etc directory to make any system-wide changes.

**/home :** The /home directory stores an individual user's home directory. If you're switching from a Windows environment, you will find the /home directory akin to the C:/Users directory. It contains user-specific configurations inside each user's directory.

**/bin :** The /bin directory contains system commands and other executable programs. The ls command that you use to list out the subdirectories along with many other useful commands is located within the /bin directory.

**/opt :** The /opt directory contains optional software packages to facilitate better compatibility of certain applications. When you install a third-party application that is not available in the official distribution repository, its software code gets stored in the /opt directory.

**/proc :** The /proc directory is a pseudo-filesystem containing information about processes and kernel parameters. It is populated with data during boot-up and is cleaned when you shut down your Linux machine.

**/tmp :** The /tmp directory is used by the system and its applications to store temporary files. You can also store temporary data in this folder, but remember that the data will be deleted upon rebooting your system.

**/root :** In Linux, every user has a separate home folder, and the root user is no exception to this. The /root directory is the home folder of the root user. You won't be able to access this directory without superuser privileges.

**/usr :** The /usr directory contains most of the files, libraries, programs, and system utilities. The /bin folder is symbolically linked to /usr/bin. The same goes for the /sbin and /lib directories.

**/var :** The /var directory is the storage space for system-generated variable files, and it includes logs, caches, and spool files. The data in /var isn't automatically deleted, so sysadmins can collect and investigate system logs if need be.

**/media :** When you connect any removable media device such as a USB thumb drive, CD, or DVD, Linux creates a subdirectory under /media where the contents of the device are laid out. This is usually done automatically by the system as soon as you plug the device in. When you remove the device, the system deletes the corresponding subdirectory.

**/mnt :** The /mnt directory is used to mount storage devices in the system temporarily. However, some Linux distributions also use /mnt as a permanent storage solution. Unlike /media, the storage device isn't automatically mounted at /mnt by the system. Sysadmins have to manually mount a storage device and populate the file system table accordingly.

**/lib :** A library is a collection of pre-compiled code that executable binaries can use. In Linux, the /lib directory serves as the storage space for all libraries needed by the binaries in the /bin directory.

**/sys :** The /sys directory contains information about the various system components and drivers. It's akin to /proc but structured differently. Sysadmins use /proc and /sys inter-changeably to collect data.

**/run :** The /run directory logs system information since boot time. You can find information about the daemons that are running, logged-in users, and more. The data stored in the /run directory can give you an idea of how the system resources are being utilized since startup.

Inside each of these folder you have well known folders and file, such as /etc/apt which is for the packet manager APT, then /etc/apt//sources.list which is the file in the APT folder you modify to add or remove sources from where your system can download packages. Take a look at the role of the following files : /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow

## How can I practice ?
o At first, use Linux through a virtual machine (you'll be able to reverse your modifications, see Virtualization chapter)
o Then, try to use Linux as your daily OS. You can also choose the DualBoot option if you want to keep your Windows or Mac system. Using Linux as your main OS will force you to practice, to encounter new errors, to solve them, and to feel more at ease on this OS.
o Build servers which are based on Linux (you can even install Linux on a Raspberry)

(This is a recommended path to learning Linux - I stick with Debian)
![[Pasted image 20240410025200.png]]

Ubuntu is very user-friendly, the distribution has been made for it, lot of packages can be installed easily. It's based on Debian
Debian can be a little more tricky, not every driver are available, you need to tinker.
ArchLinux requires a higher level of skill and knowledge of Linux. Arch offers a manual installation process that allows users to customize every aspect of the system.
Gentoo goes further into the configuration, you can setup the file system, the kernel, and you need to compile your packages.
LSF means Linux From Scratch, means what it means. Literally from scratch (prepare to pull your hair out)

*Don't be a simple user as you used to be, become a master!*


Depending of your job (see an example of different jobs you can get in cybersecurity), you'll need more advanced knowledge on Windows. For example :

If you want to work as a Pentester, you'll probably encounter Windows Servers as your targets so you need to know how they work, the services they run, ports used, encryption methods, authentication methods, and so on.

If you are looking to work as a SOC Analyst or as a Forensic Analyst or as a Malware Analyst, you need to know the most common EventID, you need to understand how the register works, what are DLLs, what are processes, threads, file systems, and so on.

That said, you should now understand that when you're using your Windows 10 or 11 computer, you are playing with 5% of what your system is really composed of.

## What should I know ?

o Windows system folder and components

In Windows, the system folder refers to the directory where critical operating system files are stored. The primary system folder is typically named "System32," and it plays a crucial role in the functioning of the Windows operating system. Here's an overview of how the Windows system folder works:

**System32 Folder:**
The main system folder on 32-bit versions of Windows is called "System32," and on 64-bit versions, there is also a "SysWow64" folder that contains 32-bit system files for compatibility reasons.
The System32 folder is located in the Windows directory (usually C:\Windows\System32).

**Core System Files:**
The System32 folder contains essential system files, dynamic link libraries (DLLs), and executables that are required for the proper operation of the Windows operating system.
Critical components such as kernel32.dll, user32.dll, and ntoskrnl.exe are found in this folder.

**Device Drivers:**
Device drivers, which are essential for the proper functioning of hardware components, are often stored in the System32\drivers subfolder.

**Executable Files:**
Many executable files (.exe) that are part of the Windows core functionality reside in the System32 folder. These files include critical system processes and utilities.

**DLL Files:**
Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) are shared files that contain code and data that multiple programs can use simultaneously. System32 houses many DLLs that applications and the operating system rely on.

**System Configuration Files:**
Important system configuration files, such as those related to the Windows Registry (e.g., registry hives), are stored in the System32\config folder.

**System Utilities:**
Various system utilities and tools, like the Command Prompt (cmd.exe) and Task Manager (taskmgr.exe), are located in the System32 folder.

**File Protection Mechanism:**
The System32 folder is protected by Windows File Protection (WFP) or Windows Resource Protection (WRP), depending on the Windows version. These mechanisms help ensure the integrity of critical system files by preventing them from being replaced or modified by unauthorized sources.

o Windows features

**TaskScheduler :** often used by malicious actors who want to make a threat persistent (taskschd.msc)
**EventViewer :** allow you to check the logs on a Windows system (eventvwr.exe). If the hacker knows what he does, he will always deleted the logs to give less clues on how he proceeded.
**BitLocker :** an encryption feature that protects your disk to being accessed by malicious people (available on Pro version of Windows only). There is a similar feature on Linux and MacOS, check them.
**Sysinternals :** tools like Process Explorer, Autoruns, and other utilities from Sysinternals Suite. These tools are both used by cybersecurity people and malicious actors.

o Windows Server roles and features

Windows Server is actually really close from Windows "user". As you can see in the picture below you find the same windows, same task bar, same menus, except that you can also install server roles :

![[Pasted image 20240410030419.png]]

## Here are the most important ones :

**Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS):**
Manages and stores information about network resources, including user accounts, groups, and computer accounts. It provides authentication and authorization services in a Windows domain. Lot of features are related to Active Directory, take a look at GPOs. (Active Directories - AD - are really sensitive assets as if a hacker can get access and admin rights on it, it means he has access to the entire infrastructure).

**DNS Server:**
Resolves domain names to IP addresses and vice versa. The DNS (Domain Name System) role is essential for proper network communication and resource access.

**File and Storage Services:**
Includes roles such as File Server and Storage Services, providing file sharing capabilities, storage management, and support for protocols like SMB (Server Message Block).

**DHCP Server:**
Assigns IP addresses and other network configuration information dynamically to devices on a network. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is crucial for automated network configuration.

**Web Server (IIS - Internet Information Services):**
Hosts and serves web applications, websites, and other web services. IIS is a powerful web server role that supports various web technologies.

**Hyper-V (Hyper-V Virtualization):**
Enables server virtualization, allowing the creation and management of virtual machines. Hyper-V is used for running multiple operating systems on a single physical server.

**Remote Desktop Services (RDS):**
Allows users to access desktops and applications remotely. RDS provides the infrastructure for secure and scalable remote access.

**Network Policy and Access Services (NPAS):**
Includes roles such as Network Policy Server (NPS) for managing network access policies, Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS), and Routing and Remote Access.

**Windows Server Update Services (WSUS):**
Manages the distribution of updates released through Microsoft Update to computers in a corporate environment. WSUS helps in centralizing update management.

**Print and Document Services:**
Manages printers and documents on the network. This role includes functionalities like print server, document conversion, and printer management.

o Windows Internals Volume 1 & Volume 2 on Amazon > these are a look in depth of Windows, more advanced

How can I practice ?
o For Windows, just use the resources mentioned in the thread,
o For Windows Server, build you own home lab and try the different roles of Windows Server, you can even try to hack them then, and try to improve the security of your infrastructure. If your host doesn't have lot of resources, you can install many roles on 1 server, but in real life be aware that it's not recommended because it represents a SPOF (Single Point of Failure, meaning if the system is not available, all roles are down).

📛 For people who are looking to hack Windows systems, a useful thing to know is LOLBAS 📛
![[Pasted image 20240410030628.png]]
*LOLBAS stands for "Living Off the Land Binaries and Scripts." It refers to a collection of legitimate binaries and scripts native to the Windows operating system that can be misused by attackers for various purposes, including post-exploitation activities and lateral movement within a compromised network.* 
  
*The concept behind LOLBAS is that attackers can leverage existing, trusted tools and utilities already present on Windows systems to carry out malicious activities, making it more challenging for security defenses to detect their actions. Since these tools and scripts are part of the operating system, they often go unnoticed by traditional security solutions.*

## What should I know ?

Coding is the common term to the act of writing instructions for a computer, which can encompass a wide range of applications and industries. This term encompasses different word depending the objective of the code you're writing :

- **Programming :** to create programs, software, operating systems
- **Scripting :** to automate tasks
- **Developing :** to create websites, front-end mostly, can also be used for back-end.

Depending on the objective there are different languages, and some of them can fit in different categories. For example, Python and JavaScript are versatile languages and they can be used in either programming, scripting or developing. But what make a language appropriated for a task or another ?

## Weeeeeell ... fasten your seat belt.

There are different levels of languages because a computer and a human do not speak the same language. A computer works based on electric signals (5V) sent or not sent. If the computer receives a signal (5V) during a short period of time, it's a 1. If the computer doesn't receive a signal during the same period, it's a 0. Look how it works :

![[Pasted image 20240410031206.png]]

Congrats, binary code "01000001" is letter "a". Can you now imagine to remember every binary codes for each letter, sign, number and then write a program made of thousands lines ? No, that's why there are different levels of languages for different purposes, take a look at the pyramid below :

*Before reading the following you should be aware that what used to be called "high level languages" are now often called "low level languages", mostly since new type of languages appeared such as Python which are higher level. In the videos below you may hear C is a high level language, but it's now more considered as low level compared to other languages such as Python. Sometimes, you can also see "Mid level" languages.*

![[Pasted image 20240410031242.png]]

## 🡇 PROGRAMMING 🡇

Assembly = often used for direct hardware manipulation, drivers, real-time needs. Assembly has many benefits compared to higher-level languages, such as Efficient Resource Utilization, Performance Optimization, Size Optimization. Be aware that there are different assembly languages for every type of architecture. Check the video below (100 seconds)

![[Pasted image 20240410031319.png]]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gwYkEK0gOk

Use cases in cybersecurity / hacking = advanced malware can be written in assembly for specific architectures and to bypass security features. Assembly is also used by malware analysts for reverse engineering when they use disassembler software on malware to understand what they do and how they work.

Low Level Languages = among all languages the most famous is probably C with different forks such as C++, Objective-C, C# (take a look at Holy-C, if you tell me who created it I'll send you 100 bytes !). It's easier to code in Low Level Languages such as C than Assembly, This type of language is the perfect balance between High-Level (which consume more resources and are not that good for big programs) and Assembly (which are better optimized but are clearly a pain in the ass to use every day). Check the video below to learn more about C language.

Use cases in cybersecurity / hacking : mostly to create programs for defensive or offensive sides, and to create malware.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3aXWizDbQ4&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fhackforums.net%2F&feature=emb_imp_woyt

High Level Languages = more close than human language and generally easier to start with for beginners. They are often used for small programs because they are easier and faster to code.

Use cases in cybersecurity / hacking : used to automate repetitive tasks, for some pentests, custom tools, bots, etc

## 🡇 SCRIPTING 🡇

![[Pasted image 20240410031536.png]]PowerShell may be asked if you work in Windows environment. Some payload can be written in PowerShell and hidden in Macros for example. Some scripts for pentesting or to vulnerability checking are written in PowerShell. If you work into compliance, PowerShell is a very useful scripting language to retrieve lot of data. It's often used by sys admins.

I gave you the 3 most common and the ones you often find in job offers, however the language you'll need as a cybersecurity professional will depend of your job, tasks and working environment (remember, try to get an idea of your future cybersecurity job, it will shorten your learning path).

![[Pasted image 20240410031850.png]]There are other scripting languages you can explore. Every language has its pros and cons, the following are also common : Ruby, Perl, Lua, VBS, JS, ...

## 🡇 DEVELOPING 🡇
### FRONT-END

Front-end development focuses on creating the visual and interactive aspects of a website or web application, ensuring a user-friendly and engaging experience (UI - user interface - and UX - user experience). The common languages for it are :

![[Pasted image 20240410031911.png]]HTML : which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is a standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web. It forms the backbone of web pages, defining the elements and layout of the content that users see in their browsers. HTML uses a system of tags to mark up and organize different parts of a document, indicating how the content should be displayed.

![[Pasted image 20240410031926.png]] CSS : which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation and formatting of a document written in HTML or XML. In simpler terms, CSS is responsible for controlling the layout, appearance, and style of web pages. It allows web developers to separate the structure and content of a document (handled by HTML) from its visual presentation.

*Here is the difference between two web pages, with and without CSS :*  
![[Pasted image 20240410031950.png]]
*CSS was introduced in 1996, at this moment, most websites used to look like the same as the picture on the right.*

 ![[Pasted image 20240410032134.png]]JavaScript : is a programming language (yep, in developing) that is primarily used to enhance the interactivity and dynamic behaviour of websites. It allows developers to create responsive and engaging user interfaces by adding functionality to the static structure and styles provided by HTML and CSS. JavaScript is a key component of front-end web development and is executed directly in the user's web browser.

Uses in cybersecurity / hacking : JS is usually the entrance door during a hacking phase because of it's interactivity (unlike HTML and CSS). Two common vulnerabilities are Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).


## BACK-END

Refers to the process of building and maintaining the server-side of a web application. Unlike front-end development, which focuses on the user interface and user experience that users interact with directly, back-end development deals with the server, database, and application logic that work behind the scenes to make the front-end functionalities possible.

Server-side Programming: Back-end developers use server-side programming languages to implement the logic and functionality of a web application. Popular back-end programming languages include:

- JavaScript (Node.js): JavaScript is not only used for front-end development but also for server-side development using platforms like Node.js.
- Python (Django, Flask): Python is widely used for back-end development with frameworks like Django and Flask.
- Ruby (Ruby on Rails): Ruby is used with the Ruby on Rails framework for building web applications.
- Java (Spring, Java EE): Java is a versatile language used for various back-end frameworks and enterprise applications.
- PHP: PHP is a server-side scripting language specifically designed for web development.

**Database Management:** Back-end developers interact with databases to store, retrieve, and manipulate data. They design database schemas, write queries, and ensure efficient data storage and retrieval. Common databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SQLite.

**Server Management:** Back-end developers are responsible for configuring and managing web servers. This includes setting up server environments, handling server security, and optimizing server performance.

**API (Application Programming Interface) Development:** Back-end developers often create APIs that allow communication between the front-end and the server. APIs define the methods and rules for requesting and exchanging data. REST (Representational State Transfer) and GraphQL are common architectural styles used for building APIs.

**Security :** Back-end developers play a crucial role in implementing security measures to protect the application and its data. This includes input validation, authentication, authorization, and encryption.

A common attack, that you probably already heard about, is SQL Injection. It uses fields in the front-end to query the database in the back-end with specific syntax in order to access data the attacker is not allowed to access, such as accounts information, and then use these information to access the account.

## What should I use to write code ?

You can use any text editor app, even the notepad or Word, however some software are better to write code for many reasons such as auto-completion, color scheme, errors, and so on.

There are plenty of them, and depending of your project you may use one or another, but I usually go with Visual Studio Code from Microsoft.

							*Here we are baby!*


## What should I know ?

Once you get the basics mentioned previously (Linux, Network, Windows, ...) you can finally start the part that probably motivates you the most.

As I mentioned above, most people dive roughly into hacking/cybersecurity before getting the basics, this often leads to :
- gap of the basics (people can have some doubts about your skills, during a job interview or a meeting with other workers)
- missing important elements when analyzing attacks
- missing important elements when doing an attack
- struggling with common stuff
- wasting lot of time on more advanced concepts because you don't have the basics, up to giving up because you're stuck

In worst cases, you can harm yourself, your computer, and your data.

## o Blue team and Red team

Before diving into all that cybersecurity has to offer, it is essential to understand the notions of Red Team and Blue Team. Although often shown in opposite ways, these teams work together to strengthen the security of an information system in their own unique way. On the one hand we have the blue team which aims to defend a given infrastructure, on the other side the red team aims to attack in order to find security vulnerabilities. These teams can sometimes be put in competition during training sessions in order to improve. Thus, for each team, the skills, tools, methodologies, professions, responsibilities, will be different. You can find, especially on TryHackMe, different courses that will allow you to familiarize yourself with these teams, and choose the one that suits you best.

## o Pentesting conditions

You have three different cases depending on the objective. Be aware that for every of them, the pentest can be performed from inside, or from outside the network's target. Be aware that when a company hires you, or ask to your company for a pentest, you need an explicit authorization signed by the demander. This document also defines the perimeter of the pentest, such as IP addresses, servers targeted, objectives, and so on.

## What should I know ?

A certification is a formal recognition by a specific organization that an individual has demonstrated a certain level of knowledge, skills, and expertise in a particular technology, product, or set of practices. Certifications are typically awarded after the individual successfully completes a standardized exam or fulfills other predetermined requirements.

There are different level of complexity of certifications, you can pass beginner certs or more advanced.

There are different ways to pass exams, such as MCQ (Multiple Choice Question), true/false, matching question, written response, oral, case studies, virtual lab.

## Here are some key aspects of IT certifications and their benefits:

**Validation of Skills:**
Certifications validate that an individual possesses the skills and knowledge necessary to perform specific tasks or work with particular technologies. They serve as a standardized benchmark for assessing competence.

Most certification programs offer official study guides, documentation, and manuals. These materials are specifically designed to cover the exam objectives and provide in-depth information on the topics you need to understand.

**Practice Exams:**
Practice exams are crucial for understanding the format of the actual test and assessing your readiness. Many certification providers offer official practice exams, and there are also third-party platforms that provide mock exams for various certifications such as https://www.examtopics.com/

**Books and Reference Materials:**
There are often books written by experts in the field that are dedicated to specific certifications. These books provide comprehensive coverage of the exam topics and may include practice questions and hands-on exercises.


**E-Learning Platforms:**
Online learning platforms offer courses tailored to specific certifications. Platforms like Udemy (warez disallowed), Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, and others provide video lectures, quizzes, and hands-on labs to help candidates grasp concepts effectively.

**Hands-On Labs and Virtual Environments:**
For technical certifications, hands-on experience is essential. Virtual labs, simulators, and practical exercises help reinforce theoretical knowledge and provide a real-world understanding of the concepts.

**Community Forums and Discussion Groups:**
Joining online forums and discussion groups related to the certification can be valuable. HF is also a good place, if you have any question feel free to ask in the White Hat Hacking .

**Flashcards and Study Notes:**
Create or use flashcards and concise study notes to reinforce key concepts and important details. This aids in quick review and memory retention.

To be honest, high priced ways are usually paid by companies you are working, or you're planning to work, for. Some of certifications can be related to cloud technologies (AWS, O365, Azure), and brands allow you to use their technologies for free for few months until a whole year.

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free (12 months with 200$ credits to use)

**EC-Council CEH (hacking - theoretical)**
This cert is more based on theoretical hacking that practical (compared to OSCP which is more practical based for example), but is a good way to start. However, be aware that companies usually prefer practical certs such as OSCP than theoretical.




## Networking Continuation
**A protocol is a set of instructions that dictate how data is transmitted and received between devices in a network. Protocols use port numbers from 0 to 65 565, they are divided in 3 categories:**

Port 53: DNS (Domain Name System)
Description: DNS translates domain names to IP addresses and vice versa.
Security Risks: Vulnerable to DNS spoofing and cache poisoning. Attackers may manipulate DNS records for malicious purposes.

Port 67: DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
Description: DHCP is used for dynamically assigning IP addresses to network devices.
Security Risks: Rogue DHCP servers can lead to IP address conflicts or unauthorized network access.

Port 68: DHCP (Client)
Description: DHCP client port used by devices to request IP addresses from DHCP servers.
Security Risks: Malicious DHCP clients can attempt to hijack IP addresses from legitimate DHCP servers.

Port 80: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
Description: HTTP is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web.
Security Risks: Susceptible to various attacks, including man-in-the-middle and cross-site scripting attacks.

Port 110: POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3)
Description: POP3 is used for retrieving emails from a mail server to a local client.
Security Risks: Transmits credentials in clear text, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping.

Port 123: NTP (Network Time Protocol)
Description: NTP is used for time synchronization between devices on a network.
Security Risks: Vulnerable to NTP amplification attacks, where attackers use insecure NTP servers to amplify and launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

Port 143: IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)
Description: IMAP is an email protocol that allows clients to access and manipulate electronic mail.
Security Risks: Vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Attackers may intercept sensitive email data.

Port 161: SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)
Description: SNMP is a protocol used for network management and monitoring of devices in an IP network.
Security Risks: SNMP versions 1 and 2c are vulnerable to interception of sensitive information, known as SNMP community string sniffing. Additionally, unauthorized access and manipulation of SNMP data are concerns.

Port 389: LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
Description: LDAP is a protocol used for accessing and managing directory information services, often used for authentication and directory services.
Security Risks: LDAP may be vulnerable to unauthorized access and directory service enumeration. Attackers can exploit weak authentication or manipulate directory entries.

Port 443: HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
Description: HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, providing encrypted communication over a network.
Security Risks: While encrypted, vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS implementations may exist.

Port 514: Syslog
Description: Syslog is a standard protocol used for message logging and event notification on a network.
Security Risks: Insecure syslog configurations may lead to unauthorized access or information leakage. Attackers may exploit weak authentication or target misconfigured syslog servers.
